# DinoSnore

## Inspiration
As college students, sleep is one of the most precious yet elusive commodities in our lives. However, despite the desire to be more well-rested, there are simply too many distractions and too little time. We wanted to tackle a problem that affected us on a daily basis, ultimately leading us to create an app that targets the difficulties of maintaining a healthy sleep schedule. 

## What it does
DinoSnore tracks user activity after a target bedtime, specifically application usage data and the amount of time wasted away on various activities in lieu of sleep. Ultimately, it compiles this data in an efficient and easily comprehensible manner for the user, providing both a breakdown of the total hours of sleep lost over a given time frame and the adverse health effects which come with each level of sleep deprivation. DinoSnore also allows users the ability to view the sleep breakdown of friends and family as well as share their own. By presenting data in a clear and objective manner, we hope to promote positive long-term behavioral changes in people of all ages.

## How we built it
We built DinoSnore in Java on Android Studios, using Android APIs to retrieve usage data as well as FireBase in order to store the aforementioned data. We also used Figma to design and build our UI. 

## What's next for DinoSnore
In the future, we hope to increase functionality, such as giving users the ability to connect with friends, as well as implement a desktop version so that we can track both laptop and mobile application usage.
